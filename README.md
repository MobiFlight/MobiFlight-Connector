### What is this repository for? ###
This repository contains the code for the Mobiflight Project

### How do I get set up? ###

#### Summary of set up ####
Checkout the code and open the MobiFlightConnector.sln project.

#### Configuration ####
Compile with DEBUG option for development and debugging
Compile with RELEASE option for release - this will also execute the release build scripts after compiling that package MobiFlight nicely.

#### Dependencies ####
All Dependecies are currently contained in the repository and not referenced dynamically from their repository

* CommandMessenger - Library for communication back and forth between PC and Arduino
* MobiflightConnector - The PC application for configuration and communication between Flightsim and Arduino
* MobiFlightUnitTests - The test suite for the MobiFlight Connector
* VersionInfo - A helper tool to detect the current release version, used during creation of Release Package

#### How to run tests ####
Run the MobiFlightConnectorTest project for unit tests
#### Build release package instructions ####
The release package is generated automatically using a RELEASE-build POST BUILD STEP. The necessary program to "sniff" the current version is part of the solution.
