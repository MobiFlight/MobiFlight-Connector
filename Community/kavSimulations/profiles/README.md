# MobiFlight Config Files

These config files have been written to allow you to use the Kav Simulations LCD displays.
There are various versions within each directory, but the general structure is that there is a 'All-In-One' config which encompases the entire cockpit.
I.e., it contains 1x FCU, 2X EFIS, 6x RMP, 2x Battery Voltage, 1x TCAS and 1x Rudder Trim.
Then there are configs split up to each section of the cockpit (Glareshield, Overhead & Pedestal).

These configs have been tested thoroughly, but if you do find any bugs, please report an issue on the GitHub page: [https://github.com/Kav-Simulations/MobiFlight-KavSimulations/issues](https://github.com/Kav-Simulations/MobiFlight-KavSimulations/issues)

There are also some still in progress, and some that are coming soon.
Please feel free to update and maintain these configs also.

A big thanks to Ralf [@elral](https://github.com/elral) for all of his help putting these together and helping to bug hunt!
