## Test Writing Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Locators**: Prioritize user-facing, role-based locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, etc.) for resilience and accessibility. Use `test.step()` to group interactions and improve test readability and reporting.
- **Assertions**: Use auto-retrying web-first assertions. These assertions start with the `await` keyword (e.g., `await expect(locator).toHaveText()`). Avoid `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` unless specifically testing for visibility changes.
- **Timeouts**: Rely on Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms. Avoid hard-coded waits or increased default timeouts.
- **Clarity**: Use descriptive test and step titles that clearly state the intent. Add comments only to explain complex logic or non-obvious interactions.


### Test Structure
- **Imports**: Start with `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';`.
- **Organization**: Group related tests for a feature under a `test.describe()` block.
- **Hooks**: Use `beforeEach` for setup actions common to all tests in a `describe` block (e.g., navigating to a page).
- **Titles**: Follow a clear naming convention, such as `Feature - Specific action or scenario`.


### File Organization
- **Location**: Store all test files in the `tests/` directory.
- **Fixtures**: Use a `fixtures/` subdirectory for custom fixtures and page objects.
- **Page objects**: Create page object files in the `fixtures/` directory to encapsulate page-specific actions, locators, and to create required state (e.g. loading test data, posting messages) for tests.
- **Data**: Use a `data/` subdirectory for test data files (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- **Naming**: Use the convention `<feature-or-page>.spec.ts` (e.g., `login.spec.ts`, `search.spec.ts`).
- **Scope**: Aim for one test file per major application feature or page.

### Assertion Best Practices
- **UI Structure**: Use `toMatchAriaSnapshot` to verify the accessibility tree structure of a component. This provides a comprehensive and accessible snapshot.
- **Element Counts**: Use `toHaveCount` to assert the number of elements found by a locator.
- **Text Content**: Use `toHaveText` for exact text matches and `toContainText` for partial matches.
- **Navigation**: Use `toHaveURL` to verify the page URL after an action.


## Example Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "./fixtures"

test.describe("Project view tests", () => {
  test("Confirm empty project view content and actions", async ({
    dashboardPage,
    page,
  }) => {
    await dashboardPage.gotoPage()

    await expect(
      page.getByText("Create your first project to get started"),
    ).toBeVisible()

    const recentProjectFilter = page.getByTestId("recent-projects-filter-bar")
    await expect(recentProjectFilter).not.toBeVisible()

    const createProjectButton = page.getByRole("button", { name: "Project" })
    await expect(createProjectButton).toBeVisible()
    await expect(createProjectButton).toHaveCount(1)
  })
})
```

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Initial Run**: Execute tests with `npx playwright test --project=chromium`
2. **Debug Failures**: Analyze test failures and identify root causes
3. **Iterate**: Refine locators, assertions, or test logic as needed
4. **Validate**: Ensure tests pass consistently and cover the intended functionality
5. **Report**: Provide feedback on test results and any issues discovered

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing tests, ensure:
- [ ] All locators are accessible and specific and avoid strict mode violations
- [ ] Tests are grouped logically and follow a clear structure
- [ ] Assertions are meaningful and reflect user expectations
- [ ] Tests follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Code is properly formatted and commented
