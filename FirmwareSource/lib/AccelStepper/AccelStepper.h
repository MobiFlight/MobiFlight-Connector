// AccelStepper.h
//
/// \mainpage AccelStepper library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino AccelStepper library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for 2, 3 or 4 pin stepper motors.
///
/// The standard Arduino IDE includes the Stepper library
/// (http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stepper) for stepper motors. It is
/// perfectly adequate for simple, single motor applications.
///
/// AccelStepper significantly improves on the standard Arduino Stepper library in several ways:
/// \li Supports acceleration and deceleration
/// \li Supports multiple simultaneous steppers, with independent concurrent stepping on each stepper
/// \li API functions never delay() or block
/// \li Supports 2, 3 and 4 wire steppers, plus 3 and 4 wire half steppers.
/// \li Supports alternate stepping functions to enable support of AFMotor (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library)
/// \li Supports stepper drivers such as the Sparkfun EasyDriver (based on 3967 driver chip)
/// \li Very slow speeds are supported
/// \li Extensive API
/// \li Subclass support

/// \par Theory
///
/// This code uses speed calculations as described in 
/// "Generate stepper-motor speed profiles in real time" by David Austin 
/// http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf or
/// http://www.embedded.com/design/mcus-processors-and-socs/4006438/Generate-stepper-motor-speed-profiles-in-real-time or
/// http://web.archive.org/web/20140705143928/http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf
/// with the exception that AccelStepper uses steps per second rather than radians per second
/// (because we dont know the step angle of the motor)
/// An initial step interval is calculated for the first step, based on the desired acceleration
/// On subsequent steps, shorter step intervals are calculated based 
/// on the previous step until max speed is achieved.

/// \par Revision History
/// \version 1.0 Initial release
///
/// \version 1.1 Added speed() function to get the current speed.
/// \version 1.2 Added runSpeedToPosition() submitted by Gunnar Arndt.
/// \version 1.3 Added support for stepper drivers (ie with Step and Direction inputs) with _pins == 1
/// \version 1.4 Added functional contructor to support AFMotor, contributed by Limor, with example sketches.
/// \version 1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Use of microsecond steps and other speed improvements
///              to increase max stepping speed to about 4kHz. New option for user to set the min allowed pulse width.
///              Added checks for already running at max speed and skip further calcs if so. 
/// \version 1.6 Fixed a problem with wrapping of microsecond stepping that could cause stepping to hang. 
///              Reported by Sandy Noble.
///              Removed redundant _lastRunTime member.
/// \version 1.7 Fixed a bug where setCurrentPosition() did not always work as expected. 
///              Reported by Peter Linhart.
/// \version 1.8 Added support for 4 pin half-steppers, requested by Harvey Moon
/// \version 1.9 setCurrentPosition() now also sets motor speed to 0.
/// \version 1.10 Builds on Arduino 1.0
/// \version 1.11 Improvments from Michael Ellison:
///   Added optional enable line support for stepper drivers
///   Added inversion for step/direction/enable lines for stepper drivers
/// \version 1.12 Announce Google Group
/// \version 1.13 Improvements to speed calculation. Cost of calculation is now less in the worst case, 
///    and more or less constant in all cases. This should result in slightly beter high speed performance, and
///    reduce anomalous speed glitches when other steppers are accelerating. 
///    However, its hard to see how to replace the sqrt() required at the very first step from 0 speed.
/// \version 1.14 Fixed a problem with compiling under arduino 0021 reported by EmbeddedMan
/// \version 1.15 Fixed a problem with runSpeedToPosition which did not correctly handle
///    running backwards to a smaller target position. Added examples
/// \version 1.16 Fixed some cases in the code where abs() was used instead of fabs().
/// \version 1.17 Added example ProportionalControl
/// \version 1.18 Fixed a problem: If one calls the funcion runSpeed() when Speed is zero, it makes steps 
///    without counting. reported by  Friedrich, Klappenbach.
/// \version 1.19 Added MotorInterfaceType and symbolic names for the number of pins to use
///               for the motor interface. Updated examples to suit.
///               Replaced individual pin assignment variables _pin1, _pin2 etc with array _pin[4].
///               _pins member changed to _interface.
///               Added _pinInverted array to simplify pin inversion operations.
///               Added new function setOutputPins() which sets the motor output pins.
///               It can be overridden in order to provide, say, serial output instead of parallel output
///               Some refactoring and code size reduction.
/// \version 1.20 Improved documentation and examples to show need for correctly
///               specifying AccelStepper::FULL4WIRE and friends.
/// \version 1.21 Fixed a problem where desiredSpeed could compute the wrong step acceleration
///               when _speed was small but non-zero. Reported by Brian Schmalz.
///               Precompute sqrt_twoa to improve performance and max possible stepping speed
/// \version 1.22 Added Bounce.pde example
///               Fixed a problem where calling moveTo(), setMaxSpeed(), setAcceleration() more 
///               frequently than the step time, even
///               with the same values, would interfere with speed calcs. Now a new speed is computed 
///               only if there was a change in the set value. Reported by Brian Schmalz.
/// \version 1.23 Rewrite of the speed algorithms in line with 
///               http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/961.09/projects/i0/Stepper_Motor_Speed_Profile.pdf
///               Now expect smoother and more linear accelerations and decelerations. The desiredSpeed()
///               function was removed.
/// \version 1.24  Fixed a problem introduced in 1.23: with runToPosition, which did never returned
/// \version 1.25  Now ignore attempts to set acceleration to 0.0
/// \version 1.26  Fixed a problem where certina combinations of speed and accelration could cause
///                oscillation about the target position.
/// \version 1.27  Added stop() function to stop as fast as possible with current acceleration parameters.

///                with some sketches. Reported by Vadim.
/// \version 1.30  Fixed a problem that could cause stepper to back up a few steps at the end of
///                accelerated travel with certain speeds. Reported and patched by jolo.
/// \version 1.31  Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com

///                a 3 phase motor such as a HDD spindle motor (and without using the AFMotor library.
/// \version 1.34  Added setPinsInverted(bool pin1Invert, bool pin2Invert, bool pin3Invert, bool pin4Invert, bool enableInvert) 
///                to allow inversion of 2, 3 and 4 wire stepper pins. Requested by Oleg.
/// \version 1.35  Removed default args from setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool, bool, bool) to prevent ambiguity with 
///                setPinsInverted(bool, bool, bool). Reported by Mac Mac.
/// \version 1.36  Changed enableOutputs() and disableOutputs() to be virtual so can be overridden.
///                Added new optional argument 'enable' to constructor, which allows you toi disable the

/// \version 1.37  Fixed a problem with step1 that could cause a rogue step in the 
///                wrong direction (or not,

/// \class AccelStepper AccelStepper.h <AccelStepper.h>
/// \brief Support for stepper motors with acceleration etc.
///
/// This defines a single 2 or 4 pin stepper motor, or stepper moter with fdriver chip, with optional
/// acceleration, deceleration, absolute positioning commands etc. Multiple
/// simultaneous steppers are supported, all moving 
/// at different speeds and accelerations. 
///
/// \par Operation
/// This module operates by computing a step time in microseconds. The step
/// time is recomputed after each step and after speed and acceleration
/// parameters are changed by the caller. The time of each step is recorded in
/// microseconds. The run() function steps the motor once if a new step is due.
/// The run() function must be called frequently until the motor is in the
/// desired position, after which time run() will do nothing.
///
/// \par Positioning
/// Positions are specified by a signed long integer. At
/// construction time, the current position of the motor is consider to be 0. Positive
/// positions are clockwise from the initial position; negative positions are
/// anticlockwise. The current position can be altered for instance after
/// initialization positioning.
///
/// \par Caveats
/// This is an open loop controller: If the motor stalls or is oversped,
/// AccelStepper will not have a correct 
/// idea of where the motor really is (since there is no feedback of the motor's
/// real position. We only know where we _think_ it is, relative to the
/// initial starting point).
///
/// \par Performance
/// The fastest motor speed that can be reliably supported is about 4000 steps per
/// second at a clock frequency of 16 MHz on Arduino such as Uno etc. 
/// Faster processors can support faster stepping speeds. 
/// However, any speed less than that
/// down to very slow speeds (much less than one per second) are also supported,
/// provided the run() function is called frequently enough to step the motor
/// whenever required for the speed set.
/// Calling setAcceleration() is expensive,
/// since it requires a square root to be calculated.
///
/// Gregor Christandl reports that with an Arduino Due and a simple test program, 
/// he measured 43163 steps per second using runSpeed(), 
/// and 16214 steps per second using run();
